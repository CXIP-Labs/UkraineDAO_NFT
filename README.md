Backwards Compatible Template for Foundry and DappTools Projects.

## Development Tools

Uses [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry). Installation instructions are included below.

## Blueprint

```ml
lib
â”œâ”€ ds-test â€” https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test
â”œâ”€ forge-std â€” https://github.com/brockelmore/forge-std
src
â”œâ”€ tests
â”‚  â””â”€ UkraineDAO_NFT.t â€” "UkraineDAO_NFT Tests"
â””â”€ UkraineDAO_NFT â€” NFT for Ukraine DAO"
```

## Development

**Setup**

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**

```bash
make build
```

**Testing**

```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:

```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.
